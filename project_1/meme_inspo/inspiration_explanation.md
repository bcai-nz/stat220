# Design analysis
From this meme, we are given the belief that it is relatable to college/university students given the presence of social media theming (external box that looks like twitter that encapsulates the content of a meme) as social media is one of the many ways we commonly communicate with others.
And, as a student at university I think this meme is largely relatable, starting the first semester with the idea that everything is fun (until you get to assignments, deadlines, etc) and by the end of all of it you'd be very exhausted. 
With the usage of this meme as inspiration, I think the features of the meme that I will change are the images, the theming and the text but I will keep the general theme of 'me now vs me later' in the delivery and creation of my meme. 
	
# How I will do this is by:
		
1. **Changing the images that I will use as components in my meme** - Having taken stats 220 and seeing how much the teacher like cats, I think I can go with a meme where when first taking stats 220, you'd feel like a kitten as everything is very new as confusing but by the end of it, you'd be strong and knowledgable when it comes to using advanced tools and softwares to create and present statistical information.

2. **Theming and general idea** - I will use the different images and I'll change the original meme's idea of showing "something cute turning into something scary" but will change the theming to that where its "something cute -> something that is still sort of cute but one that shows strength and confidence) as the goal is not to draw people away from taking stats 220 because they may think that the course is hard but the goal of the meme is to draw people into taking stats 220 for the challenge and the things that you learn along the way.

3. **Text & presentation** - Instead of doing 1 panel, with a subpanel split into two with a caption included, I think I will do a meme where it would just be one panel, that changes graphics. To make it a bit more specific to the course, I think I will also include bullet points or examples of things that a student might think at the start of stats 220 and the skills that a student would have learnt by the end of taking stats 220.

# Image necessities
- The idea of text overlaid ontop of the images that I have chosen.
- The use of contrast,color and sizing to make a design that is understandable and easy to read.
- The use of different fonts to make the meme interesting and appealing.
