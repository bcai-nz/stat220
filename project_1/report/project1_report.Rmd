<p class="paragraph"> From this inspiration meme, we are given the belief that it is relatable to college/university students given the presence of social media theming as social media is one of the many ways we commonly communicate with others. </p>

<p class="paragraph_alt"> And, as a student at university I think this meme is largely relatable as I felt a similar way starting the first semester with the idea that everything is fun (until you get to assignments, deadlines, etc) and like with the meme, the exhaustion really gets to you by the end of it. </p>

<p class="paragraph"> With the usage of this meme as inspiration, I think the features of the meme that I will change are the images, the theming and the text but I will keep the general theme of 'me now vs me later' in the delivery and creation of my meme. </p>

<h2 class="header",id="changes"> How I will do this is by changing... </h2>

<hr class="split.sections">
		
<h3 class="list_header">**1. The images that I will use as components in my meme**</h3> <p class="paragraph"> Having taken stats 220 and having a personal liking to cats, I think I can go with a meme where when first taking stats 220, you'd feel as if everything is very new as confusing but by the end of it, you'd be strong and knowledgeable when it comes to using advanced tools and software to create, communicate and present statistical information. </p>

<h3 class="list_header">**2. Message and general idea**</h3> <p class="paragraph_alt"> I will use the different images and I'll change the original memes idea of communicating "how something that looks fun can gradually turn into something scary" by changing the message to that where the meme would communicate how "a course might be hard and confusing at first but at the end of it, it would be highly rewarding" as the goal is not to draw people away from taking stats 220 because they may think that the course is hard, confusing or complex but the goal of the meme is to draw people into taking stats 220 for the challenge and the skills that you learn along the way.</p>

<h3 class="list_header">**3. Text & presentation**</h3> <p class="paragraph"> Instead of doing 1 panel, with a subpanel split into two with a caption included, I think I will do a meme where it would just be one panel, that changes graphics. To make it a bit more specific to the course, I think I will also include bullet points or examples of things that a student might think like at the start of stats 220 and the skills that a student would have learnt by the end of taking stats 220. </p>

<h2 class="header">Key components that were recreated</h2>
 - The format of the meme. (this now vs this later)
 - How the meme transitions from something cute to something different (not how the result scary like the first meme, but its something funny instead).

<h2 class="header"> Features that were changed </h2>

 -  Changed from a social media post to a one panel animation.
 - Added text and bullet points on top of the this now and this later images.

          # main_header_2 - a buff cat with a listing of things that a student 
          #                 could be good at at after they finish stats 220.

      # -- MAGICK FEATURES THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL --
      
      # 1. location = "(+/-)x(+/-)y" - might be useful to use later?
      
      # 2. font 
          # "sans", "mono", "serif", "Times", "Helvetica", "Trebuchet", "Georgia", 
          # "Palatino", "Comic Sans".
          
          # could incorporate usage of different fonts to the text to make it more meme-styled?
  
      # 3. degrees = degrees=n - might also be useful later.
      
      # 4. image_crop - useful because the second image wasn't proportioned correctly leading to the presence of whitespace (rectangle not square) - maybe could write up about this later.
  
  # putting it together
  # displaying the animation - could use nesting, objects or piping.
  
  # using objects
      # complete_anim = c(main_header_1, beginner_animation, main_header_2, expert_animation)
      # image_animate(complete_anim, fps=1)
  
  # inline nested code 
      # image_animate(c(main_header_1, beginner_animation, main_header_2, expert_animation), fps=1)
      
  # with piping
  c(main_header_1, beginner_animation, main_header_2, expert_animation) %>% image_animate(fps=1)

<p class="paragraph_alt"> In the development process when creating my meme, I had to go through several challenges such as with trying to debug the size of the second image as the image wasn't a full square but a rectangle. So, to fix this issue I had to use the image_resize command before using image_crop to get the image into the desired specifications. Additionally, when creating my meme I had also tried using extra features such as 'degrees' to change the angles of the text along with 'box_color' to make some parts of the animation more easier to read because the contrast of a thin green text on a light image would make it hard to read. Additionally, I have attempted to show creativity by adding some flair to my website, particularly through the inclusion of colors, fonts and a navigation bar. </p>

<p class="paragraph"> In data technologies, I am curious about exploring the aspect of collection and scalping and how data that can be obtained from these methods can be quantified, used and analysed comprehensively using tools like R. </p>

<p class="paragraph_alt"> One important idea that I learned in this module is the idea of 'responsive design', especially in how modern technology such as R and markdown can allow creators, no matter how proficient they are at coding into developing their designs that can be seamlessly be the same across a wide range of platforms such as that of desktops, tablets and mobile phones and that with RStudio, you can have it so every time you save you can see the output of the file. </p>

<p class="paragraph"> Especially since in college when doing DTS I know how hard it really is but with RStudio and other software like markdown it has made it a lot easier to create webpages that not only look nice, but can work on a wide range of platforms without much of an issue at all. </p>
